2. TECHNOLOGIES I USED
<br>
<br>
HTML5: I used this for the structure and content of my website.

CSS3: This was for styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations.

Key Design Principles I Followed: Minimalist design, ample white space, a sophisticated color palette (deep teal, dark grays, off-white), and high-quality typography (Lora for headings, Inter for body).

Responsive Design: I ensured the site adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Animations: I added subtle fade-in animations on scroll for a dynamic feel.

JavaScript (ES6+): I used this for interactivity, including:

Smooth scrolling navigation.

Header scroll effects.

A mobile navigation toggle.

Active navigation link highlighting.

"Back to Top" button functionality.

Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations.
